But did you know just how easy it is to brew incredible and healthy Kombucha at home?  Probably not, or else you probably wouldn't be here either.  I'll leave the why-kombucha's to the `Why Kombucha` page.  Let's get into how to do this!\r\n\r\n### What You Need\r\n* Kombucha starter SCOBY + starter tea from a friend [or from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Organic-Kombucha-Scoby-Live-Culture/dp/B009ZW8RP4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1456850263&sr=8-1&keywords=kombucha+starter)\r\n* Black tea - not ANY tea, kombucha lives on BLACK tea (camellia sinensis), most decaf black teas work as well, [this tea](http://www.amazon.com/Davidsons-Tea-English-Breakfast-16-Ounce/dp/B000SARJF6/ref=sr_1_6_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1456850119&sr=8-6&keywords=organic+black+tea) is my favorite and is extremely cost effective\r\n* Sugar (organic cane sugar is WAY better than white sugar, believe me, I buy the 10lb bag at Costco for $7)\r\n* A gallon glass jar\r\n* Secondary bottling jars\r\n  * They can be any size, but they need to be glass, airtight, able to handle pressure without breaking\r\n  * Ideally, they will also be dark and easy to clean \r\n  * I like to use kombucha bottles from storebought kombucha, [these bottles](http://www.amazon.com/Chefs-Star-CASE-Bottles-AMBER/dp/B013H0257K/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1456849816&sr=8-5&keywords=kombucha+bottles), or even mason jars.\r\n* A coffee filter and a rubber band\r\n* One or more flavor enhancers (see `Recipes`)\r\n\r\n### LET'S DO THIS!\r\n__Here's the lowdown:__\r\n* Brew 1gal of tea\r\n* Let it ferment with the Scoby and starter for a week\r\n* Bottle it and let it ferment for another week (so it gets all fizzy and amazing)\r\n* Enjoy!\r\n\r\n####Much More Detail####\r\n__Step 1: The Brew__\r\n\r\n* Brew strong tea - 8tsp/8 teabags of black tea with 1/4 gal hot water\r\n* Stir the tea and 1cup of sugar into your gal jar (I thought Kombucha had low sugar?  Yep, the SCOBY eats it)\r\n* When the sugar is dissolved, add cold water (preferably filtered, but not necessary) to fill up the jar leaving room for your SCOBY and starter.\r\n* When the tea has mostly cooled down, add your disgusting, slimy, dead-body-part-looking SCOBY and starter to the gal jar.  Mostly-cooled-down is important, because if you put it into hot water, you could kill all the good cultures (ever tried to make yogurt with boiling hot milk?  You end up with...milk)\r\n* Cover the gal jar with a coffee filter and rubber band and put it in a dark, lonely place for 1 week to rethink it's mistakes\r\n\r\n__Step 2: Wait 1 Week__\r\n\r\n* You'll see odd stuff happening - it's almost always normal check the googles for pictures\r\n* A new layer of SCOBY will form on the top, starting with bubbles, then a clear layer, maybe spots that join into one SCOBY over time.\r\n* What is a bad sign?  Fuzziness on top is bad, because that's mold.  If you get mold, you didn't use enough starter liquid, or you killed your culture with bad or hot water.  This is rare, it's never happened to me.  Every other odd appearance is pretty much normal.  The starter keeps the PH low enough so mold simply can't grow.\r\n\r\n__Step 3: The Bottling__\r\n\r\n* After 1 week, bottle it up adding any desired flavor enhancers/recipes to your bottles\r\n  * Timing is a bit of a learned-process and greatly depends on SCOBY size.  \r\n  * The first time, you probably want to go a week and a half or two weeks\r\n  * You know you bottled it too late if your brew is extremely sour, almost like apple cider vinegar\r\n  * You know you bottled it too early if it tastes mostly like sweet tea\r\n  * Once you get a mature scoby, 7 days is usually spot-on-perfect, it still has enough sugars to keep fermenting and make a really carbonated beverage\r\n  * What \"perfect\" is is really up to you, are you looking for medicinal-grade-elixer? Go 2 or more weeks! Looking for a more-healthy soda replacement? 1 week is a good gateway-drug-level\r\n* __MAKE SURE__ to keep your SCOBY and about 2 cups of starter for the next batch!\r\n* Brew up another batch, and add your SCOBY and starter to live to fight another day\r\n* If your SCOBY is more than 1\" thick, peel off some of the bottom layers and discard.  Too much SCOBY will leave you with an apple-cider-vinegar-like flavor.\r\n\r\n__Step 4: The Unveiling__\r\n\r\n* After 1 week, REFRIGERATE the bottles...for real, they'll act like a shaken soda if you don't\r\n* Enjoy\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
